# Chef Helpers
This module contains PowerShell cmdlets to automate common tasks when working with Chef in PowerShell.

If you're interested in this module you should make sure you're using the Chef PowerShell wrappers which make calling knife, chef, etc. in PowerShell much easier. This module is installed in `C:\opscode\chefdk\modules\chef\` when you install ChefDK.
